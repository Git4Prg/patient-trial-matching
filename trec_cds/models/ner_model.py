Cardiology consult recommended a right heart cath for evaluation of response to sildenafil but the patient refused. Pulmonary consult recommended an empiric, compassionate sildenafil trial due to severe dyspneic symptomology preventing outpatient living, and the patient tolerated an inpatient trial without hypotension. Patient to f/u with pulmonology to start sildenifil chronically as outpatient as prior authorization is obtained.
