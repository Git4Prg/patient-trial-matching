patient-trial-matching
==============================

This package serves as basis for the paper "Effective Matching of Patients to Clinical Trials using Entity Extraction and Neural Re-ranking"

## Installation

Tested with `python=3.8`. Install requirements with:

```bash
conda create --name patient-trial-matching python=3.8
```

```bash
conda activate patient-trial-matching
```

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ pip install -e clinical-trials 
$ pip install spacy==3.1.6   # this will raise a warning, but it is needed for the models to properly load
```

To download qrels run:

```bash
$ python download_qrels.py
```

This will install all required packages and also this project in a devel mode.


[Install](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) and launch redis server:
```bash
redis-server
```


## Data

Patients and clinical trials information can be downloaded from [TREC-CDS](http://trec-cds.org/2022.html) website:

* `topics2021.xml` file with 75 patients' data
* `topics2022.xml` file with 50 patients' data
* 5 .zip files with ClinicalTrials data

ClinicalTrials should be extracted into `data/external/ClinicalTrials/` folder.


## Usage

You can test installation by running:

```bash
$ python trec_cds/main.py
```

### Features

- Training and inference of custom entity recognition model based on spacy NER
- Indexing with BM25
- Postprocessing using topic and clinical trial related features
- re-ranking using neural model and eligibility criteria
